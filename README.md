# Java Playground

This repository is a playground for writing handy code and quick experiments. 
It’s intentionally lightweight — a place to try ideas, verify assumptions, and write small pieces of code without overhead.

## What’s inside

- Single-module setup (or describe project structure)
- Common dependencies included (adjust per tech)
- No strict rules or structure
- Write whatever you want, whenever you want

## Why this exists

Sometimes you just need a place to:

- Test a small idea
- Try out a library or API
- Reproduce a bug
- Write a quick demo or snippet

This is that place.

## Notes

This project is **not** intended to be:

- a framework
- a template
- a production-ready codebase

It’s a personal playground. Keep it simple.
